        <p>Description: 
            <ul>
              <h5>2nd Year Project</h5>
              <li>
                I worked on a team project to develop an online website for technology goods.
                It was a website for users to browse through online, the goods were mobile phones, laptops, PCs etc.
                The features that I oversaw for this project were the ordering system for the project,
                the cart for the products, the visual design, and the payment methods for the project.
              </li>

              <li>
                Challenges faced:
                I was getting some errors in my code when a user had wanted to buy a product using the payment process
                on the website. I resolved this by finding the error in the code and fixing the problem.
              </li>

              <li>
                Technology and Tools used:
                PowerShell, Python, VS Code and SQL.

              <li>
                For my 4th Year Project which is still in development, I will develop an Online Retro Jersey Football Website.
                Users will be able to use this website to Browse, Purchase, Auction there own Jerseys etc. This has been an enjoyable
                project that I have worked on and I am really looking forward to completing it.
